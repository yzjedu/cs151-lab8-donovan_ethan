* Drive Full Name  : Donovan Raymond
* Partner Full Name: Ethan
* Student ID: 1932791

Objective:
1. What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
Create a program to display the distribution of rolls of two dice.
Re-using many of the other aspects of Python we've learned so far using for
loops and creating functions

Procedure:
1. What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
   1.  First, we understood the problem 
   2. Next, we wrote an algorithm, talked about it to check if it would work, and asked for approval 
   3. Next, we tested our code
   4. Then we wrote our code and comments 
2. What were the Key concepts explored?
   1. Some of the key concepts explored were error checking, while loops, 
   for loops, functions, scope, booleans, and if else statements

Results:
1. Did your results match what you expected to get?
   1. Yes our results are exactly what we wanted and expected 
2. Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
   1. We used tested but didn't use test cases

Reflection:
1. What challenges did you encounter?
   1.  One challenge that we encountered would be brainstorming and figuring 
   out our algorithm.
2. How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
   1. I understood the problem 
   2. Made a plan 
   3. I implemented my plan and tested it
3. Did you overcome them, and how? 
   1. Yes it took some time but all of my issues were handled after looking
   back on notes and asking for help.
4. Any key takeaways? 
   1. A key takeaway for me would be how to use and create functions and
   use for loops. 
5. Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
   1. Yes, I believe I learned everything I was intended to learn 
6. What was it like working with your partner? 
   1. It was great working with Ethan.
