Objective:
In this lab, we aimed to learn about probability distributions by simulating the rolls of two dice. The objective was to practice using lists, functions, loops, and random numbers in, as well as to create an output to display the distribution of sums.
Procedure:
To solve the problem, we first broke down the requirements into smaller tasks and then implemented each one step by step. Donovan took the lead in writing the algorithm, which helped us define our functions clearly. We used techniques like input validation for the number of rolls, a loop to simulate dice rolls, and a list to store the frequency of each sum. Key concepts explored included random number generation, indexing lists to track occurrences, and formatting output with stars to represent counts visually.
Results:
Our results matched what we expected. Each sum (from 2 to 12) was counted and displayed with a corresponding number of stars, which represented the frequency of each sum rolled. We tried different test cases, including a low number of rolls to check the output format and a high number of rolls to ensure that the distribution appeared realistically close to probability expectations.
Reflection:
We faced some challenges, especially in understanding how to format the output to look like the example without overcomplicating the code. We followed the first three rules of programming:
1. Identifying the problem – understanding how to track and display the distribution.
2. Designing and planning – with Donovan’s algorithm, we had a clear outline.
3. Executing and testing – implementing and testing each part in small increments.
To overcome these challenges, we focused on simplifying the code and ensuring each function was as straightforward as possible. A key takeaway is the importance of planning with an algorithm before coding, which helped us stay organized and tackle each step methodically.
I believe I learned what I was supposed to, for this lab, especially about using lists and loops together to track counts. Working with Donovan was great, as his algorithm provided a strong foundation to build upon, making it easier to focus on the implementation details.
